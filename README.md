# The Microbial Ocean Atlas 

The Integrated Marine Observatory System ([IMOS](https://imos.org.au/)), [Bioplatforms Australia](https://bioplatforms.com/), enabled by the Commonwealth Government National Collaborative Research Scheme ([NCRIS](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris)) have come together under the CROSS-NCRIS National Data Assets program 2020 from the Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/)), to establish a data nexus - coupling genomic and oceanographic data to enhance integration.

Data wrangling is a common challenge for researchers across different data sets and disciplines. Through dedicated manipulation and standardisation of individual data sets (data wrangling) the project is providing data sets that are conducive to integration (harmonisation layer). The integrated data assets are being delivered through a visualisation and exploration platform being developed by IMOS.

The underlying annotated code is made available here, which will facilitate open code and data sharing, improve consistency and reproducibility, and accelerate the development of novel analytical tools by researchers with the skills to go further. 
Researchers and other end-users will be able to access the data asset via the visualisation platform (link above) or through existing data portals supported by IMOS - [AODN](https://portal.aodn.org.au/) and Bioplatforms Australia - [portal](https://data.bioplatforms.com/organization/about/australian-microbiome).

<b>Context of the Microbial Ocean Atlas project</b>

Microbes are fundamental to human and ecosystem health. Our ability to understand and predict the response and resilience of marine microbial communities is essential to conserving a healthy marine environment, and the subsequent social, health and economic benefits we receive. Through a globally unique collaboration, overlapping microbially focussed genomic (supported by Bioplatforms Australia) and oceanographic (supported by IMOS) data resources have been developed at all IMOS National Reference Stations around Australia. However, significant challenges remain in merging these data-streams in a standardised and interoperable manner to provide a format that is accessible and practical for non-specialist users.
This project brings together these highly complementary but disparate datasets to create an enhanced asset for the assessment of both microbial communities and the corresponding ocean environment. We will develop an interoperable data asset that builds on existing metadata standards between the Australian Microbiome Initiative (Bioplatforms Australia), in conjunction with detailed oceanographic data generated from IMOS National Reference Stations (IMOS). This will be supported by an easily accessible and highly interactive online interface for the coupled visualisation of genomics and molecular microbiological data.
 
Additionally, the combined data will be processed to produce secondary spatial assets. For example, it will be possible to generate graphical time-series that overlay molecular indices of microbial biodiversity onto physical oceanographic data. Machine learning approaches will enable distribution models of functional capacity to be overlayed onto maps of oceanographic patterns such as current vectors. This will allow users to clearly visualise temporal and spatial patterns in marine microbiological data and directly relate these to oceanographic conditions.
 
Integration and visualisation of the vast ocean data from both NCRIS capabilities will provide a highly novel framework for inferring the health and productivity of current and emerging ocean ecosystems. Such a utility will enable meaningful, cross-disciplinary collaborations between researchers investigating the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of an array of events such as bushfires, marine heatwaves, algal blooms and long-term ocean warming. The framework would also support ground-truthing and validation of the next generation of high-resolution earth system models. It is anticipated this data asset will draw new data users, support novel collaborations and produce analyses and publication outputs relevant to biology and ecology as well as providing information for stakeholders and end-users.
